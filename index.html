          <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            Inspiration is something that happens to you, rather than something
            you do — and trying to chase it is exhausting. Although hitting
            roadblocks is a normal part of creative thinking, the process can
            demotivate you and make you feel like you’ll never find new ideas.
